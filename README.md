A standalone desktop client for the open-source [Streama](https://github.com/streamaserver/streama) media server. This application provides a seamless, native-like experience by wrapping the Streama web interface in a dedicated window, with added features like automatic login and integrated fullscreen control.

The client is built with Python and PySide2 (the official bindings for the Qt UI framework), using its powerful WebView component.

## Features

*   **Seamless Auto-Login:** Configure your credentials once, and the application logs you in automatically on startup, taking you directly to the dashboard.
*   **Full Web Interface:** Provides the complete, official Streama web UI inside a native desktop window. You get 100% of the features without needing a separate browser tab.
*   **Integrated Fullscreen:** The player's fullscreen button is perfectly synchronized with the native desktop window. Toggling fullscreen from the web player, the `F11` key, or the `Esc` key works seamlessly.
*   **Clean and Professional UI:** A simple menu-driven interface keeps the focus on your media content.
*   **Self-Contained Assets:** The application icon and placeholder image are embedded directly into the application, requiring no external files after a one-time setup.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built with Python and Qt, it can be adapted to run on Windows, macOS, and other Linux distributions.

## Requirements

### 1. System Dependencies
*   **Python 3** (developed with 3.11+) and `pip`.
*   **PySide2 for Qt5**, specifically the WebEngine module. This is best installed from your Linux distribution's package manager.

### 2. Python Dependencies
